## 🚀 How to Run

Clone and launch with Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivonexauce/AI-Cybersecurity-lab-2.1.git
cd AI-Cybersecurity-lab-2.1
docker-compose up --build
```

This sets up a ready-to-use environment with AI scoring, log parsing, and smart contract auditing tools pre-installed.

🧠 AI Model Details
```
| Component     | Description                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Algorithms    | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost      |
| Training Data | Labeled Suricata & Zeek logs                     |
| Output        | Alert Priority: **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** |
```


Usage example:

```
from ai_alert_scoring.ai_model import load_model, predict_threat
from ai_alert_scoring.feature_extractor import extract_features
from suricata_alerts.parse_suricata import load_suricata_alerts

model = load_model('model.pkl')
alert = load_suricata_alerts('suricata_alerts/sample_suricata.json')[0]
features = extract_features(alert)
print("Threat Level:", predict_threat(features, model))
```
---

🧪 Smart Contract Tools
```
| Tool    | Purpose                      | Supported Format |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Mythril | Symbolic execution engine    | `.sol`           |
| Slither | Static analysis and bug scan | `.sol`           |

```

Run audits like this:
```
python smart_contract_audit/audit_with_mythril.py
python smart_contract_audit/audit_with_slither.py
```
---

📊 Visual Dashboard
Visualize alert severity distribution:
```
python visualization/dashboard.py
```
A bar graph of severity levels will appear using matplotlib.
---
